# Portfolio
I want a portfolio that displays my name, a short description, and a link to:
1. My Projects
2. An 'about me' section

My main goal is to have a somewhat simple design based off my chosen colour palette of blue and orange. Then, I want to create interest by adding smooth CSS animations to the button and background.
